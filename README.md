## Overview

This repository is my collection of Unity project's created while working through Unity's [VR Development Pathway](Development). It was created using Unity 2021.3 (LTS).

Each folder within the repo is it's own Unity project and this document provides an overview of each one.

## VR Room

### 1.1 Project Setup

Creates the example scene (`Assets/Scenes/VR Room - 1.1.unity`) with:

- Custom directional light angle
- Modern room (provided prefab)
- Hills foreground (provided prefab)
- Buildings background (provided prefab)

I included these, and the initial plane, inside an `Environment` parent folder.
